# Predicitng Beta Event Amplitude from Simulation Parameters
## Background
This repository analyzes a dataset of simulated neural activity underlying EEG/MEG signals. 

The goal of this analysis is to predict the amplitude of a specific waveform known as Beta Events from simulation parameters.

## Simulator
All simulations were performed using the Human Neocortical Neurosolver
